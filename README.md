Gamething Broadcast Service
"This is it. The dawn of a new era in gaming: a simple yet groundbreaking approach to delivering frames via a custom protocol—like Spotify did for music, we're doing for gaming."

Welcome to Gamething Broadcast Service! This repository houses two core services:

GamethingProtocolEncoder
GamethingProtocolService
Together, these classes demonstrate how to efficiently encode “delta” information for game frames in real time. It’s the first step in our bigger vision for true cloud gaming, where minimal data is transmitted to keep latency ultra-low, ensuring a smooth gaming experience from anywhere on the planet.

This code is a proof of concept that highlights the core logic of how we might transmit only the changes (the “delta”) between consecutive frames. By sending fewer bytes over the wire, we can:

Reduce bandwidth usage
Lower latency
Improve scalability
Ensure a snappy, real-time game streaming experience
And much like Spotify’s custom P2P protocol revolutionized how audio content is delivered and shared, we envision the same transformation in the gaming sphere. The code in this repository is the humble beginning of that journey.

Why the World is Ready for Cloud Gaming
Abundant High-Speed Internet: With the rollout of fiber optics, 5G, and beyond, more people have access to stable, high-throughput connections.

Global Infrastructure: Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) are everywhere, meaning game servers can live closer to the players, reducing ping times.

Device-Ubiquity: Gamers no longer want to be tethered to a single console or a high-end PC. They want to play on phones, tablets, low-powered laptops—wherever. Cloud gaming offloads heavy processing to the server, and the thin client just needs to display streaming frames.

Latency-Sensitive Innovations: Solutions like Gamething's delta frame encoding drastically reduce the data that needs to be sent, paving the way for real-time responsiveness.

How It Works
1. Capturing Frame Differences
GamethingProtocolEncoder compares a newFrame to an oldFrame pixel by pixel (or ARGB chunk by chunk).
It identifies only the changed pixels to transmit—this is our “delta.”
2. Building the Delta Packet
GamethingProtocolService then packages these changes into a neat FrameDataDto.
This “delta” is small and lightweight, making real-time updates much faster.
3. Streaming the Delta
The delta is sent to clients over your transport protocol of choice (WebSockets, UDP, HTTP/2, QUIC, etc.).
On the client side, those changed pixels update the displayed frame.
It’s a straightforward approach, but it’s a massive leap forward in data efficiency, akin to how Netflix (for video) or Spotify (for music) optimized their streaming to reduce bandwidth while delivering high-quality content.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java 11+
Maven or Gradle
A Spring Boot application context (this code fits right into a standard Spring environment)

Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone [https://github.com/gorkemz/GameThingProtocol](https://github.com/gorkemz/GameThingProtocol.git)
cd GameThingProtocol
Build (using Maven):

mvn clean install
Run inside your Spring Boot application, or import the classes into an existing project.

Example Usage
Below is a simplified snapshot of how you might integrate and call this service:

@Service
public class GameFrameUpdater {

    private final GamethingProtocolService gamethingProtocolService;

    public GameFrameUpdater(GamethingProtocolService gamethingProtocolService) {
        this.gamethingProtocolService = gamethingProtocolService;
    }

    /**
     * This method simulates receiving a new frame and broadcasting
     * the delta to connected clients.
     */
    public void onNewFrame(long frameNumber, byte[] oldFrame, byte[] newFrame) {
        // Build the delta from old to new frame
        var frameDataDto = gamethingProtocolService.buildFrameDelta(frameNumber, oldFrame, newFrame);

        // In a real-world scenario, you'd broadcast this data over WebSocket, TCP, or some custom protocol
        broadcastFrameData(frameDataDto);
    }

    private void broadcastFrameData(FrameDataDto frameData) {
        // Implementation details will vary
        System.out.println("Broadcasting changes for frame # " + frameData.getFrameNumber());
        frameData.getChangedPixels().forEach((pixelIndex, newColor) -> {
            System.out.printf("Pixel [%s] changed to color [%s]%n", pixelIndex, newColor);
        });
    }
}

Key Takeaways:

oldFrame and newFrame are typically byte arrays representing ARGB values.
buildFrameDelta(...) identifies only changed pixels, reducing the data size drastically.

Roadmap

Adaptive Encoding: Current example is naive. We plan to implement more advanced color-delta thresholds and compression strategies (e.g., RLE, region-based encoding).
Transport Layer Innovations: Possibly introducing a P2P fallback or a low-latency UDP-based approach for even more real-time performance.
Security & Validation: Ensure data integrity and encryption for safe, tamper-proof frame streaming.
Scalability: Deployment across multiple data centers worldwide, automatically routing clients to the nearest node.
